- 👋 Hi everyone, I’m @ahjiej
- 🏗️ I am a Platform Engineering & Architecture Manager based in France
- 👀 I’m interested in many things, I am on GitHub mainly because I am curious and want to keep learning software skills
- 🌱 I’m currently following the back-end and full-stack engineering career paths on Codecademy.com, along with other courses around DevOps
- 🚀 When I feel ready, I will start a project :-)

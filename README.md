- 👋 Hi everyone, I’m @ahjiej
- 🏗️ I am a Solutions Architect at a French company called Sagemcom
- 👀 I’m interested in many things, but I am on GitHub because I am learning full-stack engineering
- 🌱 I’m currently following the full-stack engineering career path on Codecademy.com
- 🚀 When I feel ready, I will start a project :-)
